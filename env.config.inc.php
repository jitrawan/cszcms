 * APPLICATION ENVIRONMENT
 *---------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * You can load different configurations depending on your
 * current environment. Setting the environment also influences
 * things like logging and error reporting.
 *
 * This can be set to anything, but default usage is:
 *
 *     'development' on localhost
 *     'testing' on local server
 *     'production' on hosting or remote server
 *
 * NOTE: - If you change these, also change the error_reporting() code below.
 *       - After you use 'development' mode. Please remove all logs file in 'cszcms/logs' 
 *         except index.html and .htaccess. (Before use production)
